# Building a Graph in Unity

This Unity project uses game objects to build a graph so that mathematical formulas are showcased based on the tutorial [Building a Graph](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/basics/building-a-graph/) by [Jasper Flick](https://catlikecoding.com/).



## Overview

The purpose of this project is to provide a practical example of using Unity game objects to create a graph representation and demonstrate mathematical formulas. By following the tutorial by Jasper Flick, you can understand the fundamentals of building a graph in Unity.
